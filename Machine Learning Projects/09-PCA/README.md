## Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

PCA is a dimensionality reduction technique that transforms data into a lower-dimensional space while preserving as much variance as possible.
 It is commonly used for visualization and noise reduction.

This folder contains examples of applying PCA before modeling or for exploratory data analysis.
