## Support Vector Machines (SVM)

SVM is a powerful supervised learning algorithm that finds the optimal hyperplane to separate data points in high-dimensional space. Itâ€™s effective in classification problems with clear margins.

This folder includes projects using SVM for binary and multi-class classification.
