# 🧠 Real-World EDA & Data Preprocessing – Airbnb NYC

A full, block-based Jupyter Notebook demonstrating an end-to-end preprocessing and exploratory data analysis (EDA) pipeline on a real-world dataset.

📌 Dataset: [Airbnb NYC 2019 – Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dgomonov/new-york-city-airbnb-open-data)

---

## 🎯 Project Objective

To build a professional, modular, and fully documented preprocessing pipeline for real-world property rental data.  
This notebook takes you from raw CSV to clean, model-ready features — ready for regression or price analysis.

---

## 🧱 Notebook Structure

All steps are implemented in one single Jupyter Notebook using clearly separated chapters:

| Chapter | Title |
|--------|-------------------------------|
| 0 | Introduction |
| 1 | Data Loading & Initial Exploration |
| 2 | Data Cleaning & Missing Values |
| 3 | Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) |
| 4 | Categorical Encoding & Feature Scaling |
| 5 | Feature Engineering |
| 6 | Data Splitting & Final Preparation |
