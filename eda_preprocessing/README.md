# ðŸ§  EDA & Data Preprocessing â€” From Zero to Pro

This project is a full educational walkthrough on how to perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and real-world data preprocessing for machine learning.

## ðŸŽ¯ Goal

To equip learners and data practitioners with hands-on, block-based, Jupyter Notebook examples that cover every step needed to clean, analyze, transform, and prepare data before model building.
