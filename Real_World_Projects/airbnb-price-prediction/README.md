# üè° Airbnb Price Prediction (NYC)

This project predicts the **nightly price** of Airbnb listings in New York City using machine learning.  
It includes full **data preprocessing**, **exploratory data analysis (EDA)**, and a **final regression model** optimized for prediction.

## üß† Project Summary

This is a **real-world regression project** aimed at:

- Predicting Airbnb nightly prices using listing features  
- Applying feature transformations (log, encoding, etc.)  
- Visualizing data distributions and correlations  
- Evaluating multiple models and selecting the best one  
- Saving the final model for real-time usage

## üìä Final Model Overview

| Metric        | Value    |
|---------------|----------|
| **Model**     | Polynomial Regression (Degree = 2) |
| **RMSE**      | `0.3917` |
| **R¬≤ Score**  | `0.6184` |

‚úÖ This model outperformed baseline and linear models, especially on non-linear patterns.

How to Use the Model for Prediction:
To make predictions on new Airbnb listings using the trained model:

 Option 1: Use predict_with_model.ipynb (Recommended)
üìÅ Simply open and run the notebook predict_with_model.ipynb step-by-step.
It includes all necessary code blocks to:

Load the trained model

Prepare and input sample data

Make predictions

Interpret the result

üìå Note: If you're using your own sample listing, replace the input values in the sample_input dictionary accordingly.
